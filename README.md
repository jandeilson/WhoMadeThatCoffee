# About Who Made That Coffee?
Three lovers of the daily coffee were arguing with each other at work about who should make the coffee... always wondering who had already made it and who was going to make it... during one of these talks came the idea of ​​note who made it and who would be next to making coffee. Thus was born Who Made That Coffee?, a minimalist web application made in [React](https://reactjs.org) with data provided by Google [spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com) and [form](https://forms.google.com).

Who Made That Coffee? is a simple, but functional prototype for its creators. In addition to answering questions about who made and should make the coffee in turn, brings a little fun by highlighting the individual quality of coffee made daily. Who doesn't want some sparklers to call their own?

All for the sake of our daily coffee. :)

## How it works
Who just made the coffee mark in the spreadsheet, and the data of who made and who will be next to make will be displayed in the application.

The personal data of the application are provided by Google Sheets, just adapt for those interested in producing coffee. [See the model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k5CE1BAZj-iPL4Pq0a8tEHze1KSyNi-UYErEivaofvA/edit?usp=sharing).

The other data displayed is within the application code, with multi language support via i18n. [See the documentation](https://github.com/alexdrel/i18n-react) if you want to adapt to your unsupported language.

## Installation
````
yarn or npm install
````

## Usage
The currently Google spreadsheet and form set up is for demonstration purposes only. It is recommended that you copy the sample template and adjust to your needs.

For random gif about coffee works you need to get a key API from [Giphy Developers](https://developers.giphy.com/).

I now believe that you are ready to execute any of the following commands:

````
yarn dev or npm run dev (to get your hands dirty)
yarn build or npm run build (to build the project package)
````
